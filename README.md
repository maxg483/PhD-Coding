Hi!

This is space for me to upload versions of my code associated with my dissertation. My research is multifaceted focusing on biological and ecological characteristics of Vallisneria
as well as how to manage invasive taxa using herbicides. As of 8/1/2025, I will have completed my initial herbicide panel (Chapter H1) for V x pseudorosulata and V. spiralis
with CET studies (Chapter H2) starting shortly after. I am currently in the middle of my phenology and morphometrics studies as well (Chapters B1 and B3, respectively) with the resource
allocation and competition studies more than likely occurring next year in 2026. Should any of this code look interesting or you would like to discuss Vallisneria please email me at 
mgebhart@gri.msstate.edu with any questions!
